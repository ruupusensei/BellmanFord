# BellmanFord
 Implementation of Bellman-Ford Algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with no negative cycles. 
 The implementation is based on the algorithm in the CLRS text, and the main code can be found in Graph.java. 
 Graph.java also contains helper functions for printing the weights of the shortest paths as well as the predecessor trees to actually show the paths themselves.
